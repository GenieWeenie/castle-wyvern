# BUILD Phase Workflow
## From Idea to Working Code

**Phase Lead:** Lexington  
**Supporting:** Brooklyn, Goliath, Broadway  
**Security:** Bronx

---

## Overview

The BUILD phase transforms specifications into working code. This is where ideas become reality.

**Duration:** Variable based on complexity  
**Output:** Functional code, tests, documentation  
**Success Criteria:** Code works, tests pass, security approved

---

## Pre-Build Checklist

Before BUILD phase begins:

- [ ] Requirements clear (from Goliath)
- [ ] Architecture approved (from Brooklyn)
- [ ] Security considerations noted (from Bronx)
- [ ] Timeline established (from Brooklyn)

---

## Build Workflow

### Step 1: Technical Design (Lexington + Brooklyn)

**Lexington:** Create technical implementation plan
**Brooklyn:** Validate approach against strategic goals

**Questions to Answer:**
- What technology stack?
- What design patterns?
- Integration points?
- Performance requirements?

**Output:** Technical design document

---

### Step 2: Development (Lexington)

**Lexington:** Write the code

**Activities:**
- Implement features
- Write unit tests
- Add error handling
- Document inline

**Best Practices:**
- Clean code principles
- Test-driven development
- Regular commits
- Security by design

**Output:** Working code with tests

---

### Step 3: Security Scan (Bronx)

**Bronx:** Run security checks

**Checks:**
- Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audit
- Access control review
- Input validation

**Output:** Security report with findings

---

### Step 4: Fix Issues (Lexington)

**Lexington:** Address security findings

**Activities:**
- Fix vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies
- Harden configurations
- Re-test

**Output:** Hardened code

---

### Step 5: Documentation (Broadway)

**Broadway:** Create documentation

**Documents:**
- Technical docs
- API documentation
- Change log
- Known issues

**Output:** Complete documentation

---

### Step 6: Pre-Measure Review

**Goliath:** Approve for measurement

**Review:**
- Code complete?
- Tests passing?
- Security approved?
- Documented?

**Decision:** Proceed to MEASURE or fix issues

## Common BUILD Phase Challenges

| Challenge | Solution | Clan Member |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Scope creep | Strict requirements | Goliath |
| Technical debt | Clean code practices | Lexington |
| Security holes | Early scanning | Bronx |
| Poor documentation | Continuous docs | Broadway |
