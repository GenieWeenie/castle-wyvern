# Quick Technical Spec

## Overview
Add a password reset feature to the login system

## Goliath's Scope
**Problem Statement:**  
Users currently lack a secure method to regain access to their accounts when passwords are forgotten, leading to potential account lockouts and support burden.

**Scope:**  
- In: Email-based password reset flow, secure token generation, password update functionality.  
- Out: Multi-factor authentication integration, social login reset options, account recovery via SMS.

**Success Criteria:**  
- Users can initiate reset via email, receive a secure time-limited token, and successfully update passwords.  
- System maintains security with token expiration and rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**Risks/Concerns:**  
- Potential security vulnerabilities if token generation is predictable.  
- Risk of increased phishing opportunities if implementation isn't carefully designed.

## Brooklyn's Approach
Alright, Lexington. Let's break this password reset feature down. Goliath's systems need this like Broadway needs a fresh plot. Here's your tactical approach:

**1. Suggested Implementation Approach**

The Aggressive Path: Implement a full-featured password reset with email verification, time-based expiration, and security questions. Go all-in or go home.

The Stealthy Path: Implement a basic token-based reset system with minimal email interaction. Quick and dirty, but gets the job done without drawing attention.

The Diplomatic Path: Create a hybrid solution - email verification but with a simplified UI/UX. Balance security with user experience.

**2. Key Files/Components to Modify**

- Authentication Controller (add reset endpoints)
- User Model (add reset token fields and expiration)
- Email Service (for sending reset links)
- Frontend Login Component (add reset UI)
- Database Schema (add token storage)
- Security Middleware (validate reset tokens)

**3. Estimated Complexity: Medium**

This isn't a simple form tweak, but it's not rebuilding the entire authentication system either. The complexity comes from token generation, validation, and secure implementation.

**4. Dependencies or Blockers**

- Need email service integration (SES or similar)
- Requires token encryption/secure storage
- May need rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Frontend team availability for UI implementation

The Diplomatic Path seems like our best bet - secure enough without overcomplicating things. Lexington, you got this. Just make sure those tokens are properly encrypted, or we'll be dealing with fallout when someone's account gets compromised.

## Next Steps
1. Review this spec
2. Run `/dev-story` to implement
3. Run `/code-review` when complete
