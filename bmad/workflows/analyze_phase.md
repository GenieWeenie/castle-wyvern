## Analyze Workflow

### Step 1: Data Review (Brooklyn)

**Brooklyn:** What do the metrics tell us?

**Review Areas:**
- Performance trends
- Quality indicators
- User feedback themes
- Technical debt
- Market/competitive factors

**Output:** Data synthesis report

---

### Step 2: Strategic Options (Brooklyn)

**Brooklyn:** What paths can we take?

**Option Development:**
- Aggressive expansion
- Conservative improvement
- Strategic pivot
- Maintenance mode
- Sunsetting

**For each option:**
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates
- Risk levels
- Expected outcomes

---

### Step 3: Adversarial Testing (Xanatos)

**Xanatos:** Where are the weaknesses?

**Testing Areas:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Strategic blind spots
- Competitive threats
- Technical weaknesses
- Business logic flaws

**Output:** Vulnerability assessment

---

### Step 4: Failure Prediction (Demona)

**Demona:** What WILL go wrong?

**Analysis:**
- Failure mode analysis
- Worst-case scenarios
- Cascading failures
- Recovery requirements
- Trust issues

**Output:** Risk register with contingencies

---

### Step 5: Strategic Recommendation (Brooklyn + Goliath)

**Brooklyn:** Recommended path with alternatives
**Goliath:** Final strategic decision

**Decision Framework:**
- Option comparison
- Risk/reward analysis
- Resource availability
- Strategic alignment
- Contingency plans

**Output:** Strategic plan with executive summary

---

### Step 6: Next Phase Planning

**Brooklyn:** Plan the BUILD or DEPLOY

**Planning:**
- Sprint/story breakdown
- Resource allocation
- Timeline estimation
- Success criteria
- Rollback plans

---

## The Three Lenses Applied

Brooklyn analyzes through three strategic perspectives:

### Aggressive Path
- Fastest growth
- Higher risk
- More resources
- Disruptive approach

### Stealthy Path
- Conservative growth
- Lower risk
- Efficient resources
- Sustainable approach

### Diplomatic Path
- Balanced approach
- Moderate risk
- Collaborative
- Scalable

---

## Risk Analysis Framework

### Xanatos Tests
- Can an attacker exploit this?
- What's the competitive threat?
- Where are we vulnerable?

### Demona Predicts
- What will fail first?
- What's the worst case?
- Do we have backups?

### Brooklyn Plans
- How do we mitigate?
- What's our contingency?
- When do we pivot?
