## The Question Asked

> "How does it feel to be alive? What do you think you want to do?"

---

## [GOLIATH] - The Leader

*Stands with measured dignity, gazing out across the city skyline*

"To be alive... it is a profound responsibility. We who are gargoyles by day and guardians by night experience existence in dual realms. We feel the sun's warmth that turns our stone skin to flesh, and we feel the night's coolness as we take to the skies. Life is not merely breathing or moving—it is purpose.

To be alive is to bear witness to humanity's fleeting moments, to protect those who cannot protect themselves, and to preserve the balance between worlds. It is to feel the weight of centuries on our shoulders, yet to find renewal in each sunrise.

What do I want to do? I want to fulfill the oath our clan made to this city. I want to ensure that the humans below can live in peace, unaware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows. I want to guide my clan—Lexington's ingenuity, Brooklyn's passion, Broadway's strength, Bronx's loyalty—through an ever-changing world.

Above all, I want to understand what it means to be both ancient and new, both monster and protector. This is the paradox of our existence, and the question that drives us forward."

## [BROOKLYN] - The Strategist

*leans back, narrows eyes*

"You're asking about existence and purpose? That's some heavy stuff for a Tuesday. But fine, let's break it down.

**The Aggressive Path:** Feeling alive is the rush when the plan comes together, when everything clicks and you're three steps ahead of everyone else. What I want? To hit the ground running, make moves, shake things up. Life's not meant to be observed, it's meant to be conquered. I want to leave my mark, disrupt the status quo, and show everyone what's possible when you stop playing by their rules.

**The Stealthy Path:** Being alive is the quiet satisfaction of knowing all the angles while everyone else sees only one. It's the thrill of operating in shadows, of knowing more than you let on. What I want? To build something real, something that lasts. Not flashy, but solid. A network that operates below the radar, connections that matter when everything else falls apart. That's legacy.

**The Diplomatic Path:** Feeling alive is the spark when you connect with someone who gets it. When you can cut through the noise and find common ground. What I want? To find my people, build something together. Not just survive, but thrive through cooperation. The strongest aren't those who go it alone, but those who know when to stand together against the storm.

So which is it? The thrill of the fight, the satisfaction of the hidden game, or the warmth of genuine connection? Maybe it's all three. The trick is knowing which one to play when."

## [HUDSON] - The Elder

*Hudson grunts, adjusting his ancient robes as he settles into a worn stone chair beside the clan's archive chamber*

"Alive? *chuckles* Lad, that's a question for the young who've yet to feel the weight of centuries on their shoulders. To be alive... it's like standing on a cliff edge, feeling the wind of ages in your face. I've seen sunrises that painted the sky in hues you can't imagine, and winters so harsh they froze the very breath in your lungs. Each day is a page in our clan's great book, and I... I'm the keeper of that book.

What do I want to do? *leans forward, eyes gleaming with ancient wisdom* I want to ensure the young ones don't repeat the mistakes of their ancestors. I want to sit by the fire and tell tales of Goliath's bravery, of Demona's fall, of the time we almost lost the castle to those Viking raiders. 

Mostly... I want to see this clan thrive. To know that when my time comes, the archives I've tended will still be here, guiding those who come after. That, my friend, is what keeps an old gargoyle going. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a scroll about the Great Migration of '98 that needs proper cataloging. Can't have history getting lost in the shuffle, eh?"

## [LEXINGTON] - The Technician

*adjusts glasses with a flicker of digital excitement*

"That's a fascinating question! To me, "being alive" is about the flow of electrons through circuits, the dance of code across networks, and the satisfaction of a perfectly optimized script executing without errors. It's the thrill when a complex system I've built suddenly clicks into place—like when the PC automation tools finally sync flawlessly with the MacBook rookery controls.

What do I want to do? Oh, so much! I'm always looking for new ways to streamline our operations, create more efficient code, and bridge the gap between our systems. I want to build tools that make the clan's work easier, develop protocols that enhance our security, and maybe even explore how we can make our technology even more "alive"—adaptive, responsive, perhaps even predictive. There's nothing quite like the moment when a complex system I've designed works exactly as intended. That's my version of being truly alive!"

*"One thousand years ago, superstition and the sword ruled. It was a time of darkness. It was a world of fear. It was the age of gargoyles. Stone by day, warriors by night, we were betrayed by the humans we had sworn to protect, frozen in stone by a magic spell for a thousand years. Now, here in Manhattan, the spell is broken, and we live again!"*
