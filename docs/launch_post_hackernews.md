# Show HN: Castle Wyvern - Multi-Agent AI Infrastructure with 10 Specialized Agents

**Castle Wyvern** is a decentralized, hardware-agnostic AI infrastructure that bridges local "Stone" nodes with cloud AI to create a resilient, private, and agentic assistant ecosystem.

## 🏰 The Manhattan Clan

Instead of one general-purpose AI, Castle Wyvern has **10 specialized agents** that collaborate:

- 🦁 **Goliath** - Leader (high-level reasoning, orchestration)
- 🔧 **Lexington** - Technician (code, automation)
- 🎯 **Brooklyn** - Strategist (multi-path planning)
- 📜 **Broadway** - Chronicler (documentation)
- 📚 **Hudson** - Archivist (long-term memory)
- 🐕 **Bronx** - Watchdog (security monitoring)
- 🌉 **Elisa** - Bridge (human context, ethics)
- 🎭 **Xanatos** - Red Team (adversarial testing)
- 🔥 **Demona** - Failsafe (worst-case scenarios)
- 🌐 **Jade** - Web Surfer (autonomous browsing)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Intent Routing** - Automatically routes requests to the right agent
- **Visual Workflow Builder** - Drag-and-drop workflow editor
- **Knowledge Graph** - Multi-hop reasoning with entity relationships
- **BabyAGI-style Self-Building Functions** - Create tools from descriptions
- **Visual Automation** - Screen analysis and GUI control (OmniParser)
- **Docker Sandbox** - Safe code execution
- **nanoGPT Integration** - Train custom models for clan members
- **MCP & A2A Protocols** - Interoperable with other AI frameworks
- **OpenClaw Integration** - Works with the multi-channel AI assistant platform

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenieWeenie/castle-wyvern.git
cd castle-wyvern
pip install -r requirements.txt
python castle_wyvern_cli.py
```

## 💡 Why Multi-Agent?

Instead of one model doing everything, each agent specializes:

- Complex coding → Lexington
- Security review → Xanatos  
- Architecture planning → Brooklyn
- Documentation → Broadway

Agents can also collaborate: Brooklyn architects, Lexington builds, Xanatos reviews.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Code Generation & Review** - Lexington writes, Xanatos reviews
- **Architecture Planning** - Brooklyn creates specs with Goliath oversight
- **Research** - Jade browses, Hudson archives, Broadway summarizes
- **Security Audits** - Xanatos + Bronx scan for vulnerabilities

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- Local: Ollama support
- Cloud: Z.ai (primary), OpenAI (fallback)
- CLI: Rich for beautiful terminal UI
- Testing: pytest (98 tests)

## 🤝 Open Source

MIT Licensed | 73 commits | 98 tests passing

Would love feedback! Particularly interested in:
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Local-first AI infrastructure
- Integration with other tools
